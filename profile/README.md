### BotBlocker

A browser extension + web platform to detect and block AI-managed social media accounts using community-driven credibility scoring.

Born from the "Dead Internet Theory," this project combats misinformation by empowering users—not just algorithms—to control their digital spaces.

Key Features:
- Real-time analysis: Flags suspicious accounts directly in your social media feed
- Collective intelligence: Voting system + comments to crowdsource bot detection
- Transparency tools: Profile scoring, voting history, and shared blocklists
- Privacy-focused: No data mining—just cleaner, more authentic interactions
